<p style='color:whitesmoke; font-size:16px;'>The 2's complement is a method for representing signed integers in a binary numeral system. It enables computers to handle positive and negative numbers using the same binary arithmetic operations. When you represent numbers in this way, you can perform arithmetic like addition and subtraction efficiently within the computer's architecture.</p><!-- END_ANSWER -->

<p style='color:whitesmoke; font-size:16px;'>To derive the 2's complement of a binary number, follow these steps:</p><!-- END_ANSWER -->

<ol style='color:whitesmoke; font-size:16px;'>
    <li>Invert all the digits of the binary number. This means changing each 0 to a 1 and each 1 to a 0.</li><!-- END_ANSWER -->
    <li>Add 1 to the least significant bit (LSB) of the inverted number.</li><!-- END_ANSWER -->
</ol>

<p style='color:whitesmoke; font-size:16px;'>This method not only simplifies the arithmetic processes within a CPU's Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) but also allows for efficient subtraction by converting it into an addition problem. This is particularly useful because the same adders within the ALU can be used to perform both addition and subtraction, optimizing computational resources.</p><!-- END_ANSWER -->

<p style='color:whitesmoke; font-size:16px;'><strong>Why is it useful?</strong></p><!-- END_ANSWER -->

<ul style='color:whitesmoke; font-size:16px;'>
    <li>Ensures uniform handling of signed integers.</li><!-- END_ANSWER -->
    <li>Simplifies the hardware design for arithmetic operations.</li><!-- END_ANSWER -->
    <li>Eliminates the need for special subtraction circuits by transforming subtraction into addition.</li><!-- END_ANSWER -->
