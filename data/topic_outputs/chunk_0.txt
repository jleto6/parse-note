**Binary Conversions**

**In the modern world,** we use decimal, or base 10, notation to represent integers. We can represent numbers using any base b, where b is a positive integer greater than 1.

**Base 10:**
- When we write 965, this can be translated as: \(9 \cdot 10^2 + 6 \cdot 10^1 + 5 \cdot 10^0\)
- More generally, \(n = a_k \cdot b^k + a_{k-1} \cdot b^{k-1} + ... + a_1 \cdot b^1 + a_0 \cdot b^0\), \(a_i, b, a_j, 0 \leq a_i < b\)

**Base b:**
- Let b be a positive integer greater than 1. Then if n is a positive integer, it can be expressed uniquely in the form \(a_k \cdot b^k + a_{k-1} \cdot b^{k-1} + ... + a_0 \cdot b^0\), where k is a nonnegative integer and \(a_k, a_{k-1}, ... , a_0\) are nonnegative integers less than b.
- This expression of n is called the base b expansion of n and can be denoted by \((a_k a_{k-1} ... a_0)_b\).

**Binary Operations**
- Computers represent integers and do arithmetic with binary (base 2) expansions of integers. In these expansions, the digits used are 0 and 1.
- Example: What is the decimal expansion of the integer that has 11011_2 as its binary expansion?
- Solution: \( (11011)_2 = 1\cdot 2^4 + 1\cdot 2^3 + 0\cdot 2^2 + 1\cdot 2^1 + 1\cdot 2^0 \)
  - \(= 16 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 1\)
  - \(= 27\)

**Base Conversion:**
- To construct the base b expansion of the integer n, divide n by b to obtain a quotient and remainder: \(n = b \cdot q_0 + a_0\), where \(0 \leq a_0 < b\).
  - The remainder, a_0, is the rightmost digit in the base b expansion of n.
- Next, divide q_0 by b to obtain \(q_0 = b \cdot q_1 + a_1\), \(0 \leq a_1 < b\).
  - a_1 is the second digit from the right in the base b expansion of n.
- Continue by successively dividing the quotients by b, obtaining the digits in the base b expansion as the remainder. The process terminates when the quotient is 0.

In an ideal computing system there would be unlimited fast memory access. However such a system is not practically achievable. Instead a memory hierarchy provides the
