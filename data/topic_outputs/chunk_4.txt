bit, an exponent, and a mantissa. To store numbers efficiently, IEEE 754 defines normalized form, meaning the first digit before the decimal is always 1 in binary (1.xxx * 2^y).

Since this leading 1 is always present, IEEE 754 does not store it explicitly. (This is called the hidden bit.) Instead, only the fractional part is stored, allowing the mantissa to hold more precision within the available bits.

This differs from standard scientific notation where the leading digit is always explicitly written (e.g., 1.23 x 10^6 in decimal). By enforcing normalization and using a hidden bit, IEEE ensures efficient storage and greater accuracy in floating point precision.

A floating-point number is always represented by:
- 1 sign bit (s) : determines whether the number is positive (0) or negative (1).
- Exponent (e) : determines how much to shift the binary point (stored using a biased form).
- Mantissa or fraction: (with an assumed 1)

### Exponential Notation

- Ex: The following are equivalent representations of 1.234
  - Scientific: 1.234 * 10^0
  - Exponential: 0.1234 * 10^1

### IEEE 754 Standard
- Single precision (32 bits), consisting of:
  - 1 sign bit
  - 8 exponent bits
  - 23 fraction bits
- Double precision (64 bits), consisting of:
  - 1 sign bit
  - 11 exponent bits
  - 52 fraction bits

### Floating Point: Normalized Scientific Notation

- Always results in the leading digit being 1
- Stored with hidden form efficiency
