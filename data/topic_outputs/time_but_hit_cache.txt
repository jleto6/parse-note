organization Multilevel Caches • Primary cache attached to CPU • Small, but fast • Level-2 cache services misses from primary cache • Larger, slower, but still faster than main memory • Main memory services L-2 cache misses • Some high-end systems include L-3 cache Multilevel Cache Example • Suppose we

Focus on minimal hit time • L-2 cache • Focus on low miss rate to avoid main memory access • Hit time has less overall impact • Results • L-1 cache usually smaller than a single cache • L-1 block size smaller than L-2 block size Summary • Cost/Performance tradeoff

Improve Cache Performance: • Use better technology • Use faster RAMs • Cost and availability are limitations • Decrease Hit Time • Make cache smaller, but miss rate increases • Use direct mapped, but miss rate increases • Decrease Miss Rate • Make cache larger, but can increases hit time

• Add associativity, but can increase hit time • Increase block size, but increases miss penalty • Decrease Miss Penalty • Reduce transfer time component of miss penalty • Add another level of cache
