associative • Fully associative Fully Associative • A block in memory may be associated with any entry in the cache • Requires all entries to be searched at once • Comparator per entry (expensive) N-way Set Associative • Each block may go to n locations • Each set contains n

entries • Block number determines which set • (Block number) modulo (#Sets in cache) • Search all entries in a given set at once • n comparators (less expensive) Associative Cache Example Associativity • All cache organizations are a variation of set associativity. • Direct mapped: 1-way set associative •

Fully associative: m-way associative where m is the number of blocks in the cache Spectrum of Associativity • For a cache with 8 entries Set Associative Cache Organization Replacement Policy • Direct mapped: no choice • Set associative • Prefer non-valid entry, if there is one • Otherwise, choose among

entries in the set • Least-recently used (LRU) • Choose the one unused for the longest time • Simple for 2-way, manageable for 4-way, too hard beyond that • Random • Gives approximately the same performance as LRU for high associativity Associativity Example • Compare 4-block caches • Direct mapped,
