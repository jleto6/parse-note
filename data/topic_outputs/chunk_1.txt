by computers. In this system, only two digits, 0 and 1, are used to encode
information. Computers rely on this binary language to perform calculations and store various types of
data efficiently.
The 2’s complement is an essential technique for expressing signed integers in binary. This method
simplifies arithmetic operations by allowing both positive and negative integers to be represented
consistently, thereby facilitating easy addition and subtraction. In 2’s complement notation, to obtain the
negative counterpart of a binary number, first invert all the digits, transforming 0s into 1s and vice
versa, then add one to the least significant bit (LSB). This approach makes binary subtraction
straightforward by converting it into an addition problem, which is more computationally efficient.
The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) forms a vital part of a computer's central processing unit (CPU). It
executes arithmetic and logical operations, including addition and subtraction, through circuits known
as adders. With the use of 2’s complement representation, the ALU can seamlessly handle both
addition and subtraction of signed integers. This ability arises because, in the realm of 2’s complement

arithmetic, subtraction is effectively executed by adding the complement of a number. Consequently,
the ALU maximizes efficiency by leveraging this method for signed computations.
The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is an integral component of a computer's central processing unit
(CPU). It is responsible for executing arithmetic and logical operations. These operations include basic
arithmetic tasks like addition and subtraction, as well as logical comparisons. The ALU utilizes
specialized circuits called adders, which are designed to perform these operations efficiently. By
implementing the 2’s complement system, the ALU handles signed integer addition and subtraction
seamlessly as subtraction can be performed by adding the 2’s complement of a number. This technique
streamlines computations by reducing subtraction tasks to addition operations, making processing
more efficient.
The Memory Unit (MU) is responsible for storing data and instructions within a computer system. It
plays a key role in ensuring that the processor has quick access to necessary information and
instructions for computational tasks. The MU stores both temporary data for immediate processing and
permanent data necessary for long-term storage. Data is organized in binary format, consistent with the
binary numeral system used by digital computers. This enables efficient data retrieval and manipulation
in alignment with computational processes performed by the ALU.
The Input Unit is the interface through which a computer receives external data and commands. It
converts user inputs or external signals into binary code that the computer system can understand and
process. Devices within the input unit include keyboards, mice, and scanners, each serving unique
functions for capturing data. The converted data is then transmitted to the Memory Unit for storage or
directly to the ALU for immediate processing, depending on the requirements of the task.
The Output Unit is responsible for presenting the results of computations performed by the CPU to the
user or other systems. It takes processed binary data from the computer and translates it into a
human-readable or machine-readable format. Devices within the output unit include monitors, printers,
and speakers. These devices convey information in various forms, such as visual displays, hard copies,
or audio. The output unit ensures that processed data is accessible in a meaningful format, completing
the cycle of data processing initiated by the input unit and executed by the CPU.
