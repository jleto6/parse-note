or data memory output. ### Data Trends and Insights - The diagram represents data flow and control paths in a basic single-cycle datapath, indicating how instructions are fetched, decoded, executed, and results stored. - It visualizes how different control signals manipulate the flow of data for tasks like arithmetic operations,

memory access, and branching. - By changing the control signals, different types of instructions (e.g., R-type, I-type) can be executed effectively. ### Conclusion - This diagram forms the basis of understanding CPU operations and how different components interact during the execution cycle, crucial for designing efficient processor architectures.

Introduction • MIPS ISA • 3 Instruction Types • R-type, I-type, J-type • Datapath and Control Unit • Simplified • Pipelined • Simple subset • Memory reference: lw, sw • Arithmetic/logical: add, addi, sub, and, or, slt • Control transfer: beq, j Instruction Format Review • Three instruction formats •

instructions executed in one clock cycle • Each datapath element can only do one function at a time • Any element needed more than once must be duplicated • Hence, we need separate instruction and data memories • Use multiplexers where alternate data sources are used for different instructions Control
