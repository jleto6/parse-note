<p style="color:whitesmoke;">Hello world! I'm Carri Ann Philbin and welcome to Crash Course Computer Science. <strong>Computers</strong> have really enabled us to achieve some pretty amazing innovations. Consider the impact of <strong>global telecommunications</strong>, <strong>international commerce</strong>, <strong>global transportation</strong>, <strong>breakthroughs in medicine</strong>, and <strong>distributed education</strong>. Moreover, <strong>online shopping</strong>, <strong>online dating</strong>, and the internet in general are all ways in which computers facilitate the exploration of our own world, and even other worlds.</p><!-- END_SECTION -->

<p style="color:whitesmoke;">However, many seemingly mundane tasks are also made possible through computers, such as remotely monitoring our pets while at work or communicating with friends through a nearly indecipherable stream of movie references. It's crucial to emphasize that computers should not be considered magical. They are not, and I repeat, <strong>are not magical</strong>.</p><!-- END_SECTION -->

<p style="color:whitesmoke;">Before delving into the topics that will be covered in the series, it's essential to understand what will not be addressed. This course will not teach you programming skills. Although <strong>programming</strong> is a vital component of computer science, encompassing the rules guiding hardware and software design, we will not focus on teaching you how to program an Arduino to monitor your plants or alter the CSS on your grandmother's sewing blog to turn visitor cursors into kittens.</p><!-- END_SECTION -->

<p style="color:whitesmoke;">The course is also not a <strong>computing course</strong>, at least not as 'computing' is conceived in the United States. In this context, computing is viewed as the activities computers perform, which we will certainly discuss. However, the aim of this course is much broader, encompassing varying interpretations of computing in different countries.</p><!-- END_SECTION -->

<p style="color:whitesmoke;">A key focus will be on examining the <strong>history of computers</strong>, tracing back to moments even before electricity was harnessed. The series will revisit pivotal <strong>design decisions</strong> that have resulted in today's technological components. This exploration will cover how operating systems function—or sometimes fail to function—and the mechanisms behind how data reaches you through the internet.</p><!-- END_SECTION -->

<p style="color:whitesmoke;">We will investigate the increasing intelligence of <strong>smartphones and other smart devices</strong> and delve into <strong>quantum computing</strong>, representing mysterious future potential, alongside the pressing contemporary issues like hacking. These areas provide a rich tapestry of topics that will be explored in depth.</p><!-- END_SECTION -->

<p style="color:whitesmoke;">Before embarking on this journey, let me introduce myself. I'm <strong>Carri Ann Philbin</strong>, an award-winning computing educator, and author of "Adventures in Raspberry Pi." I also created a YouTube video series for teenagers known as "The Geek Gurl Diaries," showcasing interviews with women in technology, science-based tutorials, and hands-on digital maker-style projects.</p><!-- END_SECTION -->

<p style="color:whitesmoke;">In my professional role, I facilitate learning about technology and creating with computers, serving as the <strong>Director of Education</strong> for the Raspberry Pi Foundation, a charity headquartered in Cambridge, UK. This work is driven by my fervent passion, not because I see computers as inherently magical devices that ease our lives—though this is sometimes contested—but because computers have undeniably become crucial fixtures in our society. From automobiles, thermostats, pacemakers to cell phones, computers are omnipresent.</p><!-- END_SECTION -->

<p style="color:whitesmoke;">It is my aspiration that by the conclusion of this course, you will gain a better comprehension and appreciation of the journey so far, as well as the future potentials computers hold.</p><!-- END_SECTION -->
