<p style="color:whitesmoke;">Welcome to <strong>Crash Course Computer Science</strong>, a journey to discover how <strong>computers</strong> have transformed a wide array of fields such as <strong>global telecommunications</strong>, <strong>international commerce</strong>, <strong>global transportation</strong>, and <strong>medicine</strong>. Importantly, they allow for <strong>distributed education</strong>, <strong>online interactions</strong>, and even casual conveniences like checking on pets remotely. It's vital to understand, however, that computers are far from magicalâ€”they are powerful by design and engineering.</p><!-- END_SECTION -->

<p style="color:whitesmoke;">This series will not provide a step-by-step guide on programming, such as coding <code style="color:#00aaff; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;">Arduino</code> projects or modifying <code style="color:#00aaff; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;">CSS</code> for fun effects on websites. While programming is a critical aspect of <strong>computer science</strong>, our focus here extends beyond typical US-centric <strong>computing</strong> paradigms. We adopt a broad perspective, exploring what <strong>computing</strong> means in various global contexts.</p><!-- END_SECTION -->

<p style="color:whitesmoke;">Our investigation into computing will revisit the <strong>history of computers</strong>, even predating electricity. This historical approach will highlight how past <strong>design decisions</strong> influence today's technologies. The course will cover essential concepts such as the function of <strong>operating systems</strong>, the mechanics of <strong>internet data transmission</strong>, and the increasing intelligence of <strong>smart devices</strong>. Future-oriented discussions will include <strong>quantum computing</strong> potential and current challenges in <strong>cybersecurity</strong>.</p><!-- END_SECTION -->
