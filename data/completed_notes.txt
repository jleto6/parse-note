<p style="color:whitesmoke;">Computers have facilitated numerous <strong>remarkable advancements</strong> across various sectors, including <strong>global telecommunications</strong>, <strong>international commerce</strong>, <strong>global transportation</strong>, and <strong>medical breakthroughs</strong>. They also support <strong>distributed education</strong> and online interactions such as <strong>shopping</strong> and <strong>dating</strong>. These systems enable us to explore and connect both locally and globally, underscoring their significant societal impact. However, it is critical to understand that these advancements are a result of human innovation rather than any intrinsic 'magic' in the machines themselves.<!-- END_SECTION --></p>

<p style="color:whitesmoke;">The course aims to broaden understanding by examining the <strong>historical evolution of computers</strong>, starting from pre-electricity eras. This exploration includes the scrutiny of <strong>design decisions</strong> influencing the development of contemporary components. Further, the course will delve into how <strong>operating systems</strong> function or fail and methods by which data, termed <strong>packets</strong>, traverse the internet. It will also examine how <strong>smart devices</strong> are continually evolving. Such a foundational view emphasizes the importance of computers and dispels the notion of their workings being inherently magical.<!-- END_SECTION --></p>

<p style="color:whitesmoke;">Importantly, the course does not focus on teaching <strong>programming skills</strong> directly. While programming underpins computer science, the intent is to focus on understanding the <strong>systems and logic</strong> behind hardware and software rather than specific coding examples like programming an Arduino for plant monitoring or altering the CSS of a blog. This distinction indicates the broad, systematic scope of the course as opposed to practical programming instruction.<!-- END_SECTION --></p>

<p style="color:whitesmoke;">As the course progresses, topics will cover <strong>quantum computing</strong> and the contemporary challenge of <strong>hacking</strong>. Quantum computing represents a potential paradigm shift in computational power and structure, while hacking highlights pervasive security threats in the digital era. Together, they should provide insight into both potential futures and present-day realities.<!-- END_SECTION --></p>

<p style="color:whitesmoke;">This course offers a comprehensive look at how technology has shaped, and continues to shape, our worldâ€”guided by the expertise and experience of Carrie Anne Philbin, an accomplished educator and advocate for technological literacy. Her role with the <strong>Raspberry Pi Foundation</strong> exemplifies her commitment to educational outreach and enabling others to engage with technology creatively. This commitment aligns with the overarching goal of the course, which is to foster a thorough appreciation and understanding of computer science's evolution, present capabilities, and future potentials.<!-- END_SECTION --></p>
