The MU stores data in binary format, which aligns with the binary numeral system used by digital computers, enabling efficient data manipulation in conjunction with processes carried out by the ALU. <!-- END_SECTION --></p>

<p style="color:whitesmoke;">The <strong>Input Unit</strong> serves as the interface through which a computer receives external data and commands. It translates user inputs or external signals into binary code that the computer can comprehend and process. Devices within this unit, such as keyboards, mice, and scanners, function to capture diverse forms of data, further transmitting them to the Memory Unit for storage or directly to the ALU for immediate action based on the task at hand. <!-- END_SECTION --></p>

<p style="color:whitesmoke;">Finally, the <strong>Output Unit</strong> is responsible for presenting the computational results performed by the CPU to the user or other systems. It translates processed binary data from the computer into a human-readable or machine-readable format.

These numbers use a base-2 numeral system consisting of only two digits: 0 and 1. Computers utilize this binary system to perform operations and represent all types of data. The <strong>2’s complement</strong> is a method used for representing signed integers in binary, allowing for the straightforward implementation of arithmetic operations, such as addition and subtraction, with uniform handling of positive and negative numbers. <!-- END_SECTION --></p>

<p style="color:whitesmoke;">To find the 2’s complement of a binary number, invert all the digits (changing 0s to 1s and vice versa) and then add one to the <strong>least significant bit (LSB)</strong>. This representation effectively simplifies binary subtraction by treating it as an addition operation, which is computationally efficient. It matters because it streamlines arithmetic procedures in digital circuits and reduces complexity. <!-- END_SECTION --></p>

<p style="color:whitesmoke;">The <strong>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</strong> is a critical component in a computer's central processing unit (CPU) that performs arithmetic and logical operations. It contains <strong>adders</strong>, which are specialized circuits designed to perform addition. By utilizing 2’s complement representation, these adders can seamlessly perform both addition and subtraction. This dual functionality is achieved because, in 2’s complement arithmetic, subtraction is executed by adding the complement of a number instead of directly subtracting it. Thus, the ALU efficiently handles signed integer operations by leveraging these principles. <!-- END_SECTION --></p>

<p style="color:whitesmoke;">The process of <strong>integer multiplication in binary</strong> operates similarly to multiplication using paper and pencil in the decimal system. Given an example where the multiplicand is <code style="color:#00aaff; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;">1000</code> (which is binary for decimal 8) and the multiplier is <code style="color:#00aaff; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;">1001</code> (which is binary for decimal 9), the multiplication process involves multiple steps akin to manual calculations. <!-- END_SECTION --></p>

<ol style="color:whitesmoke;">
    <li>The first bit from the right of the multiplier <code style="color:#00aaff; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;">1001</code> is 1, so write down the multiplicand <code style="color:#00aaff; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;">1000</code> as the first sum beneath the line. <!-- END_SECTION --></li>
    <li>Shift the multiplicand to the left, maintaining the position relative to the multiplier. The next bit of the multiplier <code style="color:#00aaff; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;">1001</code> is 0, so write down <code style="color:#00aaff; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;">0000</code> for this step. <!-- END_SECTION --></li>
    <li>Shift the multiplicand again to the left. The next multiplier bit is also 0, resulting in another set of zeros <code style="color:#00aaff; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;">0000</code> being added. <!-- END_SECTION --></li>
    <li>For the final bit of the multiplier, which is again 1, shift the multiplicand and write down the shifted result, which is <code style="color:#00aaff; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;">1000</code>. <!-- END_SECTION --></li>
</ol>

<p style="color:whitesmoke;">After executing all these steps, add together all the binary numbers derived from multiplication. The sum of these steps is the final binary product <code style="color:#00aaff; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;">01001000</code>, equivalent to decimal 72, which is the result of multiplying 8 (<code style="color:#00aaff; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;">1000</code>) by 9 (<code style="color:#00aaff; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;">1001</code>). <!-- END_SECTION --></p>
