Karnaugh Maps

Truth tables are used to completely specify a combinational hardware element, commonly called a logic block. A logic block with n inputs has 2^n entries in the truth table.

Karnaugh Maps (K-Maps) are used to simplify boolean equations derived from truth tables. Each cell in a K-Map corresponds to a row in the truth table, and groups of cells are used to minimize logic functions.
- Group size must be powers of 2. (1, 2, 4, 8)
- 'Wraparound grouping' is allowed, sometimes opposite edges of the map.
- 'Don't-care' conditions (X) can be used to form larger groups for simplification

Canonical Forms

Canonical forms are standardized ways to express Boolean functions, making it easier to build and simplify circuits. The 2 main types are Sum of Products (SOP) and Product of Sums (POS), which describe when a circuit should output a 1 or a 0. 

SOP expressions are built from minterms, which represent truth table rows where the output is 1, while POS expressions are built from maxterms, which represent rows where the output is 0.

Sum of Products:
- SOP uses minterms:
  - Look at rows where F=1 in the truth table.
  - Each 1 becomes a minterm term (A'B'C)
  - OR all the minterms together.
  For example, if F=1 at (A=0, B=1, C=0), the minterm is A'B'C'

Product of Sums:
- POS uses maxterms:
  - Look at rows where F=0 in the truth table.
  - Each 0 becomes an Or-ed term (A+B+C)
  - AND all the OR terms together.
  For example, if F=0 at (A=1, B=0, C=1), the maxterm is A'B+C'

Binary Conversions

In the modern world, we use decimal, or base 10, notation to represent integers. We can represent numbers using any base b, where b is a positive integer greater than 1.

Base 10:
For example, 965, this can be translated as: \(9 \cdot 10^2 + 6 \cdot 10^1 + 5 \cdot 10^0\)

Base b:
Let b be a positive integer greater than 1. Then if n is a positive integer, it can be expressed uniquely in the form, where k is a nonnegative integer and \(a_k a_{k−1} . . . a_1 a_0\) are nonnegative integers less than b. 

This expansion of n is called the base b expansion of n and can be denoted by \( (a_k a_{k−1} . . . a_1 a_0 )_b\).

Binary Expansions:
Computers represent integers and do arithmetic with binary (base 2) expansions of integers. In these expansions, the digits used are 0 and 1.

Example: What is the decimal expansion of the integer that has \( (11011)_2 \) as its binary expansion?
Solution: \( (11011)_2 \)
\[1 \cdot 2^4 + 1 \cdot 2^3 + 0 \cdot 2^2 + 1 \cdot 2^1 + 1 \cdot 2^0\]
\[ = 16 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 1\]
\[ = 27\]

Base Conversion:
To construct the base b expansion of the integer n, divide n by b to obtain a quotient and remainder: \( n = bq_0 + a_0 \), where \( 0 \le a_0 < b \).
The remainder, \( a_0 \), is the rightmost digit in the base b expansion of n.
Next, divide \( q_0 \) by b to get \( q_0 = bq_1 + a_1 \), where \( 0 \le a_1 < b\).
Continue until the 2nd digit from the right in the base b expansion of n.
Continue by successively dividing the quotients by b, obtaining the digits \( a_2, a_3, \ldots \), as the remainder. The process terminates when the quotient is 0.
