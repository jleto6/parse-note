<p style="color:whitesmoke;">The representation of data in computers fundamentally relies on <strong>binary numbers</strong>, which utilize a <strong>base-2 numeral system</strong>. This system consists of two digits: <code style="color:#00aaff; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;">0</code> and <code style="color:#00aaff; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;">1</code>. It is through this binary framework that computers execute operations and encode all forms of data. <!-- END_SECTION --></p>

<p style="color:whitesmoke;"><strong>2’s complement</strong> is a technique for representing signed integers in binary. This method is essential because it enables uniform handling of arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction, regardless of whether the numbers are positive or negative. <!-- END_SECTION --></p>

<p style="color:whitesmoke;">To obtain the <strong>2’s complement</strong> of a binary number, one needs to invert all bits—transforming <code style="color:#00aaff; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;">0</code>s to <code style="color:#00aaff; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;">1</code>s and vice versa—then add one to the <strong>least significant bit (LSB)</strong>. This arrangement greatly facilitates binary subtraction by converting it into an addition operation, which heightens computational efficiency. <!-- END_SECTION --></p>

<p style="color:whitesmoke;">The <strong>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</strong> is pivotal in a computer's <strong>central processing unit (CPU)</strong>, as it carries out arithmetic and logical operations. A fundamental part of the ALU's operations involves <strong>adders</strong>, specialized circuits committed to performing addition. By integrating 2’s complement representation, these adders can smoothly execute both addition and subtraction operations. Through the use of 2’s complement arithmetic, subtraction is achieved by adding the complement of a number instead of executing direct subtraction. Consequently, the ALU capitalizes on this approach for efficient handling of signed integer operations. <!-- END_SECTION --></p>

<h2 style="color:whitesmoke;">Binary Multiplication</h2>

<p style="color:whitesmoke;">Binary multiplication operates on principles analogous to the <strong>paper and pencil decimal multiplication</strong> method. By exploring a representative example—where the <strong>multiplicand</strong> is <code style="color:#00aaff; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;">1000</code> (binary for decimal 8) and the <strong>multiplier</strong> is <code style="color:#00aaff; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;">1001</code> (binary for decimal 9)—we can better apprehend the process, which closely emulates manual multiplication. <!-- END_SECTION --></p>

<ol style="color:whitesmoke;">

Since the first bit of the multiplier from the right is <code style="color:#00aaff; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;">1</code>, write down the multiplicand as the initial addition term. <!-- END_SECTION --></li>
  <li>Shift the multiplicand one position to the left. The subsequent bit of the multiplier is <code style="color:#00aaff; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;">0</code>, so document <code style="color:#00aaff; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;">0000</code> corresponding to this step. <!-- END_SECTION --></li>
  <li>Shift the multiplicand left again. Given that the next multiplier bit is also <code style="color:#00aaff; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;">0</code>, another set of zeros <code style="color:#00aaff; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;">0000</code> is added. <!-- END_SECTION --></li>
  <li>For the final bit, which is <code style="color:#00aaff; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;">1</code>, shift the multiplicand and record the shifted result <code style="color:#00aaff; font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;">1000</code>. <!-- END_SECTION --></li>
