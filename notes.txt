In the series "Crash Course Computer Science," hosted by Carrie Anne Philbin, the focus will be on the broad impact and history of computers rather than on programming skills or specific computer tasks. This series emphasizes understanding the role computers have played in facilitating global communications, commerce, and advancements in various sectors such as medicine and education. Computers enable humans to explore both familiar environments and unknown frontiers, managing everything from intricate data exchanges to simple, everyday tasks like pet interaction via the internet.

The course will not cover programming languages or specific skills like coding in Arduino or editing CSS. Instead, it will explore the development of computers, even predating modern electrical systems. The series will delve into how design decisions influenced current computer components, an understanding of operating systems, internet data transmission, and the development of smart technologies. Topics will also include futuristic technology such as quantum computing, as well as contemporary issues like cybersecurity threats.

Carrie Anne Philbin brings her experience as an accomplished educator and advocate for tech education, emphasizing the pervasive nature of computers in modern life. She highlights that while computers significantly impact society—from personal devices to critical health instruments—they are not inherently magical or infallible. Her work with the Raspberry Pi Foundation supports educational efforts to deepen public knowledge about computing, aiming to enhance awareness of technological history and potential future developments.
