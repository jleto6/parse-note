This system facilitates all data operations and storage in computing environments. Computers operate using this binary language to perform calculations and represent different types of data efficiently.

To express signed integers, the 2’s complement method is utilized. This technique enables straightforward arithmetic operations by uniformly handling both positive and negative numbers. To find the 2’s complement of a binary number, each digit is inverted, changing zeros to ones and vice versa, followed by adding one to the least significant bit. This approach simplifies binary subtraction by converting it into an addition operation, which is computationally efficient.

The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), an essential component of a computer's central processing unit (CPU), carries out arithmetic and logical operations, including addition and subtraction, using circuits called adders. By employing 2’s complement representation, the ALU efficiently manages both addition and subtraction of signed integers. It achieves this dual functionality as subtraction becomes an addition problem, using the complement of a number instead of direct subtraction.

Binary multiplication mirrors the traditional multiplication process used with decimal numbers, resembling the paper and pencil method. For example, multiplying binary numbers 1000 (representing decimal 8) and 1001 (representing decimal 9) involves shifting and conditional addition based on the multiplier's bits. The multiplicand is shifted left and added to the product if the corresponding bit in the multiplier is 1, or simply shifted if it is 0.

The process unfolds through sequential steps: first, aligning the multiplicand below the multiplier, then performing shifts and additions based on the bits of the multiplier. For example, with the multiplier 1001, the operation would produce intermediate sums like 1000, 0000, 0000, and finally 1000 again, which are subsequently added to achieve the final binary product, 01001000. This product corresponds to the decimal result of 72, achieved by multiplying 8 by 9. The method of shifting and conditional addition highlights the efficiency with which computers, through the ALU, perform multiplication, leveraging hardware for rapid and accurate results.Binary numbers form the fundamental basis for data in computers, utilizing the base-2 system solely with the digits 0 and 1. All computing operations rely on this binary language to efficiently store and manipulate data. Signed integers in this system are represented using the 2’s complement method, which simplifies arithmetic operations by managing both positive and negative numbers uniformly. This method involves inverting each binary digit, swapping zeros with ones, and adding one to the least significant bit.

Within a computer's central processing unit, the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is crucial for executing arithmetic and logical tasks. Essential operations like addition and subtraction are handled by circuits known as adders. Subtraction is performed efficiently by treating it as an addition problem using 2’s complement, wherein the ALU adds the complement to simplify the operation.

Binary multiplication reflects the traditional approach used with decimal numbers, employing techniques similar to those used in manual calculations. By examining the bits of the multiplier, the multiplicand is either shifted and added to the result if the bit is 1, or merely shifted if it is 0. This process involves sequential shifts and additions, exemplified by multiplying binary numbers such as 1000 and 1001, producing a final result of 01001000, which equals the decimal 72. The efficient handling of multiplication by the ALU underscores the computational power achieved through hardware optimization.Carrie Anne Philbin opens the Crash Course Computer Science series by noting the remarkable advancements facilitated by computers, such as global telecommunications, international commerce, and worldwide transportation.
