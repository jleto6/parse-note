Carrie Anne Philbin, host of Crash Course Computer Science, discusses the transformative impact computers have had across numerous fields. Computers facilitate global telecommunications, international commerce, and transportation. They have enabled breakthroughs in medicine and distributed education, while also revolutionizing online shopping and dating. Additionally, they allow personal interactions, like remotely monitoring pets or communicating through dynamic digital channels. However, Philbin emphasizes that computers are not magical devices.

The course will not include programming tutorials or specific tasks like programming an Arduino or modifying website CSS. Instead, it will focus on broader concepts of computer science and technology's history, beginning before the advent of electricity. Key topics will include the evolution of computer components, the functioning and potential failings of operating systems, and the digital transmission of data over the internet. The course will explore the increasing intelligence of smartphones and smart devices, as well as futuristic concepts like quantum computing and challenges such as hacking.

Philbin introduces herself as an award-winning computing teacher and the author behind various educational projects. She is involved with the Raspberry Pi Foundation, a tech education charity, where she serves as the Director of Education. Philbin expresses a deep passion for the role computers play in society, noting that computers are integral in a wide array of everyday devices and systems, from cars and thermostats to pacemakers and cell phones. She aims for the course to enhance understanding and appreciation of computers' historical and future roles in society.
Carrie Anne Philbin introduces herself as the host of Crash Course Computer Science, reinforcing her enthusiasm for the transformative capabilities of computers. She acknowledges that computers have facilitated significant advancements in various sectors such as global telecommunications, international commerce, and transportation. They have played a crucial role in breakthroughs in medicine and the dissemination of education. Additionally, they have revolutionized online activities such as shopping and dating and have enabled exploration both on Earth and beyond. Computers also support everyday interactions, like remotely checking on pets from work or engaging in dynamic communications with friends.

Philbin emphasizes that despite their capabilities, computers are not magical devices. The course will not include programming tutorials, such as writing code for Arduino to water plants or altering a blog's CSS to change its aesthetics.

The course centers on broad concepts of computer science and the historical progression of technology, going back to before the introduction of electricity. It will cover the evolution of computer components, the functionality and potential malfunctions of operating systems, and the transmission of data over the internet. The curriculum will feature discussions on the increasing intelligence of smartphones and smart devices, as well as futuristic topics like quantum computing and more critical issues like hacking.

Philbin identifies herself as an award-winning computing teacher, author, and Director of Education for the Raspberry Pi Foundation. She has created educational resources, including "The Geek Gurl Diaries," a video series for teenagers featuring interviews and science-based tutorials. Philbin is notably passionate about the societal role of computers, as they are present in cars, thermostats, pacemakers, and cell phones. She aims for the course to deepen understanding and appreciation of computers' past developments and potential future advancements.
