In the episode, Carrie Anne Philbin introduces the role of computers in modern society. Computers facilitate remarkable advancements, including global telecommunications, international commerce, advancements in medical fields, distributed education, and the convenience of online shopping and dating. They enable exploration of our world and beyond, as well as more everyday activities like communicating remotely. Despite appearances, computers should not be perceived as magical devices. 

The series will not cover programming directly, such as coding an Arduino or adjusting CSS on a website. Instead, it will explore the underlying principles that inform hardware and software design, without focusing on specific programming skills. The course will not follow the American perspective of computing as a singular goal but will take a broader view, acknowledging different international interpretations of computing.

The curriculum will include the history of computers, tracing design decisions that have influenced modern components. It will cover how operating systems function, the mechanics behind internet data transmission, and the progression of smart technology. Future-oriented topics like quantum computing and current issues like hacking will also be addressed.

Carrie Anne Philbin's background includes being a computing teacher, author, and director of education at the Raspberry Pi Foundation. She highlights the pervasive influence of computers in society, from vehicles and thermostats to medical devices and smartphones. Philbin aims to enhance understanding and appreciation of technology's impact and potential.
Carrie Anne Philbin, the host of Crash Course Computer Science, emphasizes the significant impact of computers, which enable achievements like global telecommunications, international commerce, and advances in medicine and education. They facilitate everyday conveniences such as online shopping, dating, and remote communication. While these capabilities are extraordinary, Philbin insists that computers are not magical devices.

The series will not focus on teaching programming tasks like coding Arduino for plant monitoring or altering CSS for websites. Instead, it will delve into the foundational principles guiding hardware and software design, foregoing specific programming instructions. The course embraces a broader perspective on computing, contrasting with the American view that often sees computing as a singular goal.

Philbin outlines the curriculum, which will include studying the history of computers, examining design choices that have shaped modern technology before electricity, and understanding how operating systems function. Discussion will also cover data transmission over the internet, the evolution of smart technology, and developing areas like quantum computing along with current challenges such as hacking.

Carrie Anne Philbin brings a wealth of experience as a computing teacher, author, and director of education at the Raspberry Pi Foundation. Her work encourages learning about technology and fostering practical skills in digital creation. Despite any debates about the benefits of computers, their role in areas from cars and thermostats to medical devices and smartphones is undeniable. Philbin seeks to enhance the understanding of technology's impact, tracing its progression and exploring its future potential. By the end of the course, a deeper comprehension and appreciation of technology's evolution and possibilities are anticipated.
Carrie Anne Philbin opens the Crash Course Computer Science series by emphasizing the profound capabilities of computers, which have transformed various facets of modern life. Achievements made possible by computers include global telecommunications, international commerce, and significant advancements in global transportation and medicine. They also play a role in distributed education, online shopping, and online dating. The internet, a critical system enabled by computing, allows for a multitude of activities, such as exploring new worlds and facilitating seemingly mundane tasks like monitoring pets from afar or sharing emoji-laden communications with friends. Despite these capabilities, Philbin stresses that computers are not magical entities.

The series delineates what it will cover and what it will not. Programming skills, such as coding an Arduino to monitor plants or modifying CSS for website design, will not be part of the course. Instead, the focus will be on understanding the rules behind hardware and software design logic. This educational journey takes a wider approach than the American perspective, which often views computing singularly as a goal; other global interpretations will be acknowledged.

The curriculum will include exploring the history of computers, even extending to times before the advent of electricity. There will be discussions on design decisions that have shaped modern computing components and how operating systems operate or fail. Additional topics will cover the mechanics of internet data transmission, the advancement of smart technology, emerging fields like quantum computing, and challenges such as hacking.

Carrie Anne Philbin is an accomplished computing teacher, author, and director of education at the Raspberry Pi Foundation in Cambridge, UK. She has created tutorials and projects that engage young people with technology, and her work is underscored by passion. Her involvement with the Raspberry Pi Foundation shows her commitment to helping others learn about technology and digital creation. Philbin acknowledges debates about the ease brought by computers but emphasizes their undeniable influence across societal sectors, including automobiles, thermostats, pacemakers, and smartphones. Her aim is for participants to gain a better understanding and appreciation of the historical and potential advancements of computing by the course's conclusion.
