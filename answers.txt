A step-by-step calculation involves breaking down a problem into smaller, manageable parts, solving each part in sequence. This method ensures that each step is clear and concise, reducing errors and making the overall process easier to follow. It often begins with understanding the problem, identifying required operations, performing calculations in order, and reviewing the results for accuracy.To multiply 1000 by 1001, start by multiplying 1000 by the rightmost digit of 1001, which is 1, resulting in 1000. Shift this result one place left, then multiply 1000 by the next digit of 1001, which is 0, resulting in 0000. Shift again and multiply 1000 by the third digit of 1001, another 0, resulting in 0000. Finally, shift once more and multiply 1000 by the leftmost digit of 1001, which is 1, resulting in 1000. Add the results: 1000 + 0000 + 0000 + 1000 = 1001000.
