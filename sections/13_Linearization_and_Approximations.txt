13: Linearization and Approximations  
- Linearization (tangent line approximation) formula: \(L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a)\)  
- Using linearization and differentials to approximate function values  
- Examples: ln(1.07), \(e^{0.49}\), \(\sqrt{101}\), etc.  
- Comparing linearization and differentials for estimates
