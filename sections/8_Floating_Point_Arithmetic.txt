8: Floating Point Arithmetic  
- IEEE 754 representation: sign, exponent, mantissa  
- Normalized scientific/form (hidden bit)  
- Single precision (32-bit) and double precision (64-bit) layouts  
- Floating point arithmetic and its difference from integer operations  
- Normalized notation: why and how  
- Example: representation and conversion
