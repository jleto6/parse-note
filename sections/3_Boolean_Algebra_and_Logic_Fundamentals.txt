3: Boolean Algebra and Logic Fundamentals  
- Canonical forms: Sum of Products (SOP) and Product of Sums (POS)  
- Minterms and maxterms: connecting truth tables to canonical forms  
- Constructing SOP from rows where output = 1  
- Constructing POS from rows where output = 0  
- Examples using minterms and maxterms
