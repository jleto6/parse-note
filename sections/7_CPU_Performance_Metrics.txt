7: CPU Performance Metrics  
- Clock cycles, clock period, and clock frequency  
- Instruction count  
- Cycles per instruction (CPI)  
- CPU Time calculations:  
  - CPU Time = Instruction Count x CPI x Clock Cycle  
  - Effects of instruction mix on CPI  
- Examples illustrating calculation of execution and overall CPU time
