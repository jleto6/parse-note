# ðŸ“š Study Tool

An ongoing project that generates and refines academic notes from raw learning material. Built to process content such as lecture transcripts, textbook excerpts, and other class resources into structured, high-quality notes that are easier to study and review.

## Current Features

- Human-in-the-loop feedback system for iterative note improvement
- Converts unstructured study material into clean, organized notes
- Refines selected text without altering original formatting or structure

## Purpose

This project is being developed to improve the study process by combining clarity-focused note formatting with interactive refinement. The aim is to support deep understanding while keeping the user in control of content quality.

The tool is part of a broader exploration of NLP, AI-assisted learning, and full-stack development. It is actively evolving toward a more interactive platform with plans for features like:
- Queryable note section
- User-based organization and history
- Improved content structuring using NLP techniques
