# ðŸ“š ParseNote

An AI-assisted learning tool that transforms raw academic materialâ€”like lecture transcripts and textbook excerptsâ€”into structured, high-quality notes for easier studying and review. It uses NLP techniques and retrieval-augmented generation to support clarity, structure, and interactivity.

## About

This project applies real AI workflows including LLMs, retrieval-augmented generation, prompt engineering, and distillation to understand unstructured text and generate structured, readable output. It served learning project for exploring applied NLP and language model techniques through a useful, working tool.

## Planned Development

The long-term goal is to develop this into a full-scale web application with user accounts, version history, structured note organization, and interactive features built on top of advanced AI processing.

## How to Use

Clone the repo and run the app from `app/main.py` using Python. Once Flask starts and opens a local port, upload the documents you want to structure directly through the interface. The app will process the input and return cleaned, organized output based on the AI workflow.
