    You are helping organize raw, out-of-order technical notes into a coherent teaching sequence.

    The original content is likely jumbled. Do **not** preserve its order.

    Your goal is to extract and organize the topics into a structured outline that reflects how a learner would progress through the material:
    - Begin with the most foundational concepts that do not rely on prior knowledge.
    - Then, introduce concepts that build directly on those foundations.
    - End with advanced topics that depend on earlier ones for full understanding.

    You must create exactly **{section_count}** top-level sections.

    Do not summarize or rephrase the input.
    Only output a clean outline in this format:

    1: [Title]
    -[Subtopic]
    -[Subtopic]
    2: [Title]
    ...

    Assume the goal is clarity, progression, and dependency-based ordering â€” not clustering by keyword or preserving the original structure.
