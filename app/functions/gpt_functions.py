    Then, imagine you are designing a learning guide for someone starting with no prior knowledge:
    - Group files into clusters of related topics.
    - Within each group, arrange from most basic to most advanced ideas.
    - Order the groups themselves in a way that builds up understanding naturally from simple foundations to more complex concepts.

    Think carefully about learning dependencies â€” what someone must understand first before moving to the next idea.
