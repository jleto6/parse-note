by rounding Rounding Modes • IEEE Standard has five rounding modes: • round to nearest, ties to even (default) • round to nearest, ties away from zero • round towards plus infinity • round towards minus infinity • round towards 0 Rounding Hardware • To round accurately, we need the

x 20 0.101111 x 20 Result 1.01111 x 2-1 Normalize 1.1000 x 2-1 Round; simple round up • Without round bit, result is 1.0111 Sticky Bit • Round to nearest problems • need to know if actual result is closer to the next rounded value up or the next rounded

value down. • With 4-bit significand, a result of 1.11011 could round to 1.1101 if rounding down or 1.1110 if rounding up • Potentially need a much greater number of bits • Instead keep “sticky” bit (S): • used to determine whether there are any 1 bits truncated below the

20 Round to nearest Without S rounds to 1.0000. Exceptions • Invalid operation • result of operation is a NaN (except = or !=) • inf. +/- inf.; 0 * inf; 0/0; inf./inf.; x remainder y, y = 0; • sqrt(x) where x < 0, x = +/- inf. •

Overflow • result of operation is larger than largest representable number • flushed to +/- inf. if overflow exception is not enabled Exceptions • Divide by 0 • x/0 where x = 0, +/- inf.; • flushed to +/- inf. if divide by zero exception not enabled • Underflow •

subnormal result OR non-zero result underflows to 0 • Inexact • rounded result not the actual result (rounding error = 0) Exceptions • IEEE Standard specifies defaults and allows traps to permit exceptions to be handled at the program level • contrast with the more usual result of aborting the
