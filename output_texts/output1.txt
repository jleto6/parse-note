arithmetic, subtraction is effectively executed by adding the complement of a number. Consequently, the ALU maximizes efficiency by leveraging this method for signed computations. The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is an integral component of a computer's central processing unit (CPU). It is responsible for executing arithmetic and logical operations. These operations include basic arithmetic tasks like addition and subtraction, as well as logical comparisons. The ALU utilizes specialized circuits called adders, which are designed to perform these operations efficiently. By implementing the 2’s complement system, the ALU handles signed integer addition and subtraction seamlessly as subtraction can be performed by adding the 2’s complement of a number. This technique streamlines computations by reducing subtraction tasks to addition operations, making processing more efficient. The Memory Unit (MU) is responsible for storing data and instructions within a computer system. It plays a key role in ensuring that the processor has quick access to necessary information and instructions for computational tasks. The MU stores both temporary data for immediate processing and permanent data necessary for long-term storage. Data is organized in binary format, consistent with the binary numeral system used by digital computers. This enables efficient data retrieval and manipulation in alignment with computational processes performed by the ALU. The Input Unit is the interface through which a computer receives external data and commands. It converts user inputs or external signals into binary code that the computer system can understand and process. Devices within the input unit include keyboards, mice, and scanners, each serving unique functions for capturing data. The converted data is then transmitted to the Memory Unit for storage or directly to the ALU for immediate processing, depending on the requirements of the task. The Output Unit is responsible for presenting the results of computations performed by the CPU to the user or other systems. It takes processed binary data from the computer and translates it into a human-readable or machine-readable format. Devices within the output unit include monitors, printers, and speakers. These devices convey information in various forms, such as visual displays, hard copies, or audio. The output unit ensures that processed data is accessible in a meaningful format, completing the cycle of data processing initiated by the input unit and executed by the CPU.
